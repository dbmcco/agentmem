# Workgraph

Use workgraph for task management.

**At the start of each session, run `wg quickstart` in your terminal to orient yourself.**
Use `wg service start` to dispatch work — do not manually claim tasks.

## For All Agents (Including the Orchestrating Agent)

CRITICAL: Do NOT use built-in TaskCreate/TaskUpdate/TaskList/TaskGet tools.
These are a separate system that does NOT interact with workgraph.
Always use `wg` CLI commands for all task management.

CRITICAL: Do NOT use the built-in **Task tool** (subagents). NEVER spawn Explore, Plan,
general-purpose, or any other subagent type. The Task tool creates processes outside
workgraph, which defeats the entire system. If you need research, exploration, or planning
done — create a `wg add` task and let the coordinator dispatch it.

ALL tasks — including research, exploration, and planning — should be workgraph tasks.

### Orchestrating agent role

The orchestrating agent (the one the user interacts with directly) does ONLY:
- **Conversation** with the user
- **Inspection** via `wg show`, `wg viz`, `wg list`, `wg status`, and reading files
- **Task creation** via `wg add` with descriptions, dependencies, and context
- **Monitoring** via `wg agents`, `wg service status`, `wg watch`

It NEVER writes code, implements features, or does research itself.
Everything gets dispatched through `wg add` and `wg service start`.

## Memo

- `agentmem` is the intentional tracker/memory package used by the PAIA ecosystem. It is not stray dependency noise.
- Postgres support lives in `agentmem` base dependencies in `pyproject.toml`; it is not declared as a separate optional extra.
- If another repo asks for `agentmem[postgres,...]` and `uv` warns that `postgres` is not a valid extra, the mismatch is in the consuming repo's dependency spec, not in `agentmem` ownership or purpose.
